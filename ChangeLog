Boxed.  Copyright (c) 2005 Michael Schmitz

May 2005:
	1.  Repackaged using automake tools.  Earlier was packaged with Anjuta.

Long time ago:
	1.  I stripped all Windows code and replaced it with GTK code. This mainly
	concerns the files "interface", "main", and "view". Also, much of the code
	was neatened, optimized, and commented.

April 2003:
	1.  First version of boxed (originally called "boxes") released.
