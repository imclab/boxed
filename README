Boxed version 1.00

A clone of the good old Beasts game for the classic Macintosh.

Blurb:
Cage the squirrels by pushing boxes around them. But beware: the squirrels
bite. As the levels increase not only do the squirrels multiply, but they
quicken and the boxes needed to confine them become scarce!
